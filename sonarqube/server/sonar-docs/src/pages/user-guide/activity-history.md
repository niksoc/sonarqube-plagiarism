The Project Activity page offers a comprehensive list of the analyses on file for a project (subject to [Housekeeping](/instance-administration/housekeeping/)), and the ability to see the evolution of project measures over time.

Graphs on the activity page help you understand the evolution of up to three measures of your choice against each other. Graph mouseovers show the measure values and events associated with particular analyses.

## Events
There are four types of events:

* Quality Gate - the status of the [quality gate](/user-guide/quality-gates/) changed.
* Profile - the [quality profile](/instance-administration/quality-profiles/) used to analyze the project changed - either the profile was edited, or a different profile was used to analyze the project.
* Version - the project's version changed.
* Other - an event was manually created on a snapshot. See [Managing History](/project-administration/managing-project-history/)

Events are shown on the [project front page](/user-guide/project-page/) and in the project Activity page.
