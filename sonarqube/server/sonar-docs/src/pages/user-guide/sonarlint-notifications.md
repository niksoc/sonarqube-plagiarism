_SonarLint Smart Notifications is available as part of the [Developer Edition](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/developer.html) and [above](https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/)._
<!-- /sonarqube -->

Smart notifications allow developers using Connected Mode in SonarLint to receive in-IDE notifications from {instance} when:

* the Quality Gate status (failed / success) of a project /solution _open in the IDE_ changes
* a {instance} analysis raises new issues _introduced by this developer in a project /solution open in the IDE_

## Activate/deactivate Notifications
The activation or deactivation of notifications must be done individually, by each developer directly in SonarLint (on the IDE side).

<!-- sonarqube -->
Receiving notifications is configurable on the SonarLint side on a {instance} server-by-server basis.
