## Free plan organization

Free plan organizations are public. This means that almost everything is visible to any user - even anonymous ones:

* Projects
* Issues
* Quality Profiles
* Quality Gates
* Rules

The following pages are restricted:

* Members: to members of the organization
* Administration pages: to administrators of the organization

## Paid plan organization

Paid plan organizations are private. This means that nothing is visible to non-members of the organization. In other words, you need to be a member of the organization to see:

* Projects - which are private by default
* Issues
* Quality Profiles
* Quality Gates
* Rules
* Members

The administration pages are obviously also restricted to administrators of the organization.

### Want to make one project public?

If you are on a paid plan organization but want to make a project public (for instance because you are developing an open-source library), this is possible. You will have to manually make the project public in its **Administration > Permissions** page. Once done, you will notice the "Public" badge on the project.

As soon as you have one public project, the following pages will become visible to any user:

* Projects
* Issues
* Rules

"Quality Profiles" and "Quality Gates" pages will remain restricted to members only - since you might not want to unveil some information used by your private projects.
