SonarCloud is the leading product for Continuous Code Quality online, totally free for open-source projects. It supports all major programming languages, including Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, C/C++ and many more. If your code is closed source, SonarCloud also offers [a paid plan](/sonarcloud-pricing/) to run private analyses.

SonarCloud offers end-to-end integrations for teams leveraging the following solutions in their development processes:

* [GitHub.com](/integrations/github/)
* [Bitbucket Cloud](/integrations/bitbucketcloud/)
* [Azure DevOps Services](/integrations/vsts/)

Are you ready to eliminate bugs and vulnerabilities? Will you champion quality code in your projects?
