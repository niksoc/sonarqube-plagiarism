*Portfolio PDFs are available as part of the [Enterprise Edition](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/enterprise.html) and [above](https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/).*

A user with administrative rights on a portfolio can configure email distribution of the PDF. From a Portfolio Home Page go to **Administration > Executive Report**.

### Frequency
You can tune the email frequency of the PDF Report. The possible values are:

* Daily: report is sent during the first portfolio calculation of the day (if any)
* Weekly: report is sent during the first portfolio calculation of the week (if any) from Monday
* Monthly (default): report is sent during the first portfolio calculation of the month (if any), starting from the first day of the current month

### Other Recipients
If people without SonarQube accounts want to receive the PDF, you can feed the administrative "Other Recipients" field with their email addresses.
