If {instance}'s results aren't relevant, no one will want to use it. That's why precisely configuring what to analyze for each project is a very important step. Doing so allows you to remove noise, like the issues and duplications marked on generated code, or the issues from rules that aren't relevant for certain types of objects.

{instance} gives you several options for configuring exactly what will be analyzed. You can

* completely ignore some files or directories
* exclude files/directories from Issues detection (specific rules or all of them) but analyze all other aspects
* exclude files/directories from Duplications detection but analyze all other aspects
* exclude files/directories from Coverage calculations but analyze all other aspects

You can make these changes globally or at a project level. At the global level, the navigation path is  **Administration > General Settings > Analysis Scope**. At the project level, the navigation path is **Project Settings > General Settings > Analysis Scope**

## Patterns

Paths are relative to the project base directory. The following wildcards can be used:

* `*`	- Match zero or more characters  
* `**` - Match zero or more directories  
* `?` - Match a single character  

Relative paths are based on the fully qualified name of the component.

Example|Matches|Does not match
----|----|----
`**/*Bean.java`|org/sonar.api/MyBean.java <br/> org/sonar/util/MyOtherBean.java|org/sonar/util/MyDTO.java
`**/*Bean?.java`|org/sonar/util/MyOtherBean1.java|org/sonar/util/MyOtherBean.java <br/> org/sonar.api/MyBean.java <br/> org/sonar/util/MyDTO.java
`org/sonar/*`|org/sonar/MyClass.java <br/> org/sonar/MyOtherClass.java|org/sonar/util/MyClassUtil.java
`org/sonar/**/*`|org/sonar/MyClass.java <br/> org/sonar/MyOtherClass.java <br/> org/sonar/util/MyClassUtil.java|

## Ignore Files
We recommend that you exclude generated code, source code from libraries, etc. There are four different ways to narrow your analysis to the source code that will be relevant to the development team. You can combine them all together to tune your analysis scope. Additionally, we automatically exclude from analysis the files described in your projects' `.gitignore` files. This behavior can be disabled. See `sonar.scm.exclusions.disabled` in the [Analysis Parameters](/analysis/analysis-parameters/) page for details.

### Source Directories
Set the [sonar.sources](/analysis/analysis-parameters/) property to limit the scope of the analysis to certain directories.

### File Suffixes
Most language plugins offer a way to restrict the scope of analysis to files matching a set of extensions. Go to **Administration > General Settings > [Language]** to set the File suffixes property.

### Choosing Files
Your first line of defence having a well-defined set of files in your analysis is your `sonar.sources` value. For projects built and analyzed with Maven, Gradle, or MSBuild, this value is defined automatically with a generally thorough, yet sane value. For other projects, you want to make sure `sonar.sources` is set to your project _sub-directory_ that actually contains your source files. Setting it to `.` will cast a wider net than most people intend.

Once you've got all the files _in_ your analysis that you want, it's time to look at whether you have any files you'd rather leave _out_ of your analysis, such as JavaScript libraries, and generated files. Those can be handled with Exclusions. Specifying an exclusion means that everything under your `sonar.sources` directory will be included in analysis _except_ the files with paths that match your exclusion regular expression.

![Use exclusions to keep libraries and generated files out of analysis](/images/exclusions.jpg)

To use exclusions to analyze everything but the specified files, go to **Administration > General Settings > Analysis Scope > Files**.

* **Source File Exclusions** (`sonar.exclusions`) - to exclude source code files
* **Test File Exclusions** (`sonar.test.exclusions`) - to exclude test files

The vast majority of needs are met simply by setting `sonar.sources` carefully. Most other needs are met with the addition of a few simple exclusions. In a few corner cases, it is necessary to be explicit about what's _included_ in analysis and leave out everything else, but that is not the normal case, and setting inclusions should not be the first thing you try when configuring a new project.

![Use inclusions in the rare case that you want to analyze only a subset of files](/images/inclusions.jpg)

To use exclusions to analyze _only_ the specified subset(s) of files in `sonar.sources`, go to **Administration > General Settings > Analysis Scope > Files**.

* **Source File Inclusions** (`sonar.inclusions`)
* **Test File Inclusions** (`sonar.test.inclusions`)

You can set these properties at both the project and global levels.

See the Patterns section below for more details on the syntax to use in these inputs.

## Ignore Issues
You can have {instance} ignore issues on certain components and against certain coding rules. Go to **Administration > General Settings > Analysis Scope > Issues**.

Note that the properties below can only be set through the web interface because they are multi-valued.

### Ignore Issues on Files
You can ignore all issues on files that contain a block of code matching a given regular expression.

Example:
* *Ignore all issues in files containing "@javax.annotation.Generated"*  
`@javax\.annotation\.Generated`

### Ignore Issues in Blocks
You can ignore all issues on specific blocks of code, while continuing to scan and mark issues on the remainder of the file. Blocks to be ignored are delimited by start and end strings which can be specified by regular expressions (or plain strings).

Notes:

* If the first regular expression is found but not the second one, the end of the file is considered to be the end of the block.
* Regular expressions are not matched on a multi-line basis.

### Ignore Issues on Multiple Criteria
You can ignore issues on certain components and for certain coding rules. To list a specific rule, use the fully qualified rule ID.

[[info]]
| You can find the fully qualified rule ID on the Rule definition.

Examples:

* *Ignore all issues on all files*  
KEY = `*`  
PATH = `**/*`
* *Ignore all issues on COBOL program "bank/ZTR00021.cbl"*  
KEY = `*`  
PATH = `bank/ZTR00021.cbl`  
* *Ignore all issues on classes located directly in the Java package "com.foo", but not in its sub-packages*  
KEY = `*`  
PATH = `com/foo/*`
* *Ignore all issues against coding rule "cpp:Union" on files in the directory "object" and its sub-directories*  
KEY = `cpp:Union`  
PATH = `object/**/*`  

### Restrict Scope of Coding Rules

You can restrict the application of a rule to only certain components, ignoring all others.

Examples:

* *Only check the rule "Magic Number" on "Bean" objects and not on anything else*  
KEY = `checkstyle:com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.checks.coding.MagicNumberCheck`  
PATH = `**/*Bean.java`
* *Only check the rule "Prevent GO TO statement from transferring control outside current module on COBOL programs" located in the directories "bank/creditcard" and "bank/bankcard". This requires two criteria to define it:*  
KEY #1 = `cobol:COBOL.GotoTransferControlOutsideCurrentModuleCheck`  
PATH #1 = `bank/creditcard/**/*`  
KEY #2 = `cobol:COBOL.GotoTransferControlOutsideCurrentModuleCheck`  
PATH #2 = `bank/bankcard/**/*`

## Ignore Duplications

You can prevent some files from being checked for duplications.

To do so, go to [Administration > General Settings > Analysis Scope > Duplications](/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings) and set the *Duplication Exclusions* property. See the Patterns section for more details on the syntax.

## Ignore Code Coverage

You can prevent some files from being taken into account for code coverage by unit tests.

To do so, go to **Administration > General Settings > Analysis Scope > Code Coverage** and set the *Coverage Exclusions* property. See the Patterns section for more details on the syntax.
