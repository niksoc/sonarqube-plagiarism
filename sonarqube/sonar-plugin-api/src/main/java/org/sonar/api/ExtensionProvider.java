/**
 * Factory of extensions. It allows to dynamically create extensions depending upon runtime context. One use-case is
 * to create one rule repository by language.
 *
 * <p>Notes :
 * <ul>
 * <li>the provider is declared in Plugin.getExtensions()</li>
 * <li>the provider must also add annotation {@link ServerSide}, {@link ComputeEngineSide} and/or {@link BatchSide}</li>
 * <li>the provider can accept dependencies (parameters) in its constructors.</li>
 * <li>the method provide() is executed once by the platform</li>
 * <li>the method provide() must return an object, a class or an Iterable of objects. <strong>Arrays are excluded</strong>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * {@literal @}ServerSide
 * public class RuleRepositoryProvider extends ExtensionProvider {
 *   private Language[] languages;
 *
 *   public RuleRepositoryProvider(Language[] languages) {
 *     this.languages = languages;
 *   }
 *
 *   public List<RuleRepository> provide() {
 *     List<RuleRepository> result = new ArrayList<RuleRepository>();
 *     for(Language language: languages) {
 *       result.add(new RuleRepository(..., language, ...));
 *     }
 *     return result;
 *   }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 *
 * @since 2.3
 * @deprecated since 6.0 should no more be used
