/**
 * A generator of UUID as a byte array which is made of two parts:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a base, which is machine and time dependant and therefor will change with time</li>
 *   <li>an increment</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This generator can be used in two ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>either the base and the increment are changed for each UUID (with time for the base, with each call to
 *   {@link #generate()} for the increment) and {@link #generate()} should be used</li>
 *   <li>or the increment can be the only changing part (for performance boost and less concurrency) and
 *   {@link #withFixedBase()} should be used.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong> {@link WithFixedBase#generate(int)} can be considerably faster than {@link #generate()} but
 * is limited to generate only 2^23-1 unique values.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Heavily inspired from Elasticsearch {@code TimeBasedUUIDGenerator}, which could be directly
 * used the day {@code UuidFactoryImpl} is moved outside module sonar-core.
 * See https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/TimeBasedUUIDGenerator.java
